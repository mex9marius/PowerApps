# PowerApps

I've decided to put up this free public repository to share some of my knowledge around the Power Platform with all the comunity members out there.

## What can I find here?
I will be posting advanced topics about common practice, how to do's, and also respond to queries coming from users all accross the world really.

## Who is the author?
My name is Marius, I am originaly from Romania, but been living in the UK for several years now.
Been working with Microsoft technologies in various Enterprise environments for a couple of years now, and solved some of the most complex business problems for Nissan, Heathrow Airport, Home Group, and many other local companies.
In the past years I have all my focus on the Power Platform, especially on Canvas Apps built on either SharePoint, CDS, or SQL Server with full reporting suite in Power Bi and automation through scalable low on resources Flows.
While developing Enterprise Solutions, I have encountered many scenarios where the community did not provided an exact solution to deal with at the time limitation or my exact scenario.
So I have decided to share my solutions with the community so other will not experience the same frustration I had at the time.

I hope you all find this usefull, and if you do, I only ask that you use Social Media or any other appropriate channels to spread the news really.
